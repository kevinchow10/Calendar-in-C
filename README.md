# Calendar-in-C
This project is made using c language programming. We make it using Dev-C++ 5.11 with the compiler TDM-GCC 4.9.2 64-bit Release. This project is used to show the calendar in which the user can insert, search, or delete the event based on what he/she want. On the main interface, the user will be displayed by a calendar with the current date. Then, there will be an option in which the user can choose it by pressing the alphabet on the keyboard with the following instruction: 1. Pressing ‘N’ to view next month, 2. ‘P’ to view the previous month, 3. ‘G’ to go to the specific date, 4. ‘S’ to show event(s) for a specific date, 5. ‘I’ to insert a new event, 6. ‘D’ to delete the event of the specified date, and 7. ‘Q’ to quit the program. The date that has been inserted by the event will be highlighted to show that there is a schedule on that day. This program is free to be used or developed by the others. If you have any question or suggestion, feel free to contact us.
